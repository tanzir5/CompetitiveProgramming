#. PICKS THEOREM :
	Given a simple polygon constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with integer coordinates) 
   such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points, Pick's theorem provides a simple formula for calculating the area A of this polygon in terms of the number i of lattice points in the interior located in the polygon and the number b of lattice points on the boundary placed on the polygon's perimeter.

   A = i + b/2 - 1.

# Length of a curve  f(x) on interval  [a,b] is equal to Integrate(a,b) [ sqrt( 1 + [f'(x)]^2 ) ] dx

# Surface area of a spherical cap = 2*pi*r*h [ h = height of the sperical cap ] 
# Volume of a spherical cap = (pi * h) / 6 * ( 3 * a * a + h * h)
# Fermat point: a point inside a triangle ABC such that PA + PB + PC is minimized. 
	Construction: Pick two sides and draw equilateral triangle on them. Join opposite vertices.
