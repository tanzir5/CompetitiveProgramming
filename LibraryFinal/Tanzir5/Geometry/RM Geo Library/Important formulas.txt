9. PICKS THEOREM :
	Given a simple polygon constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with integer coordinates)
   such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points, Pick's theorem provides a simple formula for calculating the area A of this polygon in terms of the number i of lattice points in the interior located in the polygon and the number b of lattice points on the boundary placed on the polygon's perimeter.

   A = i + b/2.0 - 1.
